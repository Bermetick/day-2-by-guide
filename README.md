# day-2-by-guide
My 2nd day in github

In next 30 day I am planning to boost my programming skills on Python. First, I will overview previous skills. Second, I will start continuing with functions. And then I will get till the end of the course (alternatively, taking into account that there are finals and other projects are coming, I will get done at least 70 % for sure). Thank you! If anyone is reading this, wish me a gooood luuuuck! : )
